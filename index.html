          What wins fantasy football championships? Grit? Luck? Mind-games with
          your league opponents? As a fantasy manager you probably wish you
          could just draft Pablo Sanchez from the Backyard Football game with
          the first pick in your league and automatically win championships.<br /><br />
          Unfortunately, even the best fantasy football players do not put up
          the numbers we saw from our favorite videogame speedster. That is
          where data analytics comes into play. We identify players that have
          more upside and potential based off the numbers, and share those
          results with you! With the advantages you gain from picking the
          players our analytics pinpoint, your team will average enough points
          that you will not have a need for a fictional superstar like Pablo.

          What is Target Share? How does it help you determine which players to
          draft? Or what player is the best to target in a trade? At Backyard
          Fantasy-Football we do not just crunch the numbers, but also explain
          the purpose of the data. Data without understanding will not help you
          succeed, and that is what a lot of other sites do. They give you tons
          of data without any explation. Here is an example of what Backyard
          Fantasy-Football can do for you!
        </li>
        <li class="target-share-description__li">
          <strong>Target Share- </strong>measures the percentage of all passing
          attempts directed at a particular player. This is a key piece of data
          for fantasy owners, as it shows the expected usage of a player.
          Players with a higher target share will generally produce more points
          that those with a lower percentage.
        </li>
        <li class="target-share-description__li">
          <strong>Team Pass Attmept- Season- </strong> Number of pass attempts
          from a team. Having a player with a high target share is definetly a
          benefit, however, a player that has a slightly lower target share may
          be more vaulable if their offense makes a significantly larger number
          of pass attempts per game.
        </li>
        <li class="target-share-description__li">
          <strong>Player Pass Attmept- Season- </strong> Number of pass attempts
          that target the listed players
        </li>
