This is a refactored verision of my Backyard Fantasy Football. The original was built on Flask with Python to be able to utlize data transformation in pandas. The original site had a rather slow load time because it was build in Python. Instead, I took the code that analyzed and sorted the data and put it in a API built on Python. I then created this React app that accesses the API for the datra, but renders everything in React instead.
